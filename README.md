#Cognistra — AI Workflow Automation

Cognistra is an intelligent workflow automation platform that combines AI-powered agents with a visual orchestration system. Unlike traditional rule-based automation tools, Cognistra can understand intent, adapt to change, resolve exceptions, and optimize processes in real time—turning static workflows into self-improving, resilient systems.

🚀 Features

🤖 AI Agents — Context-aware, adaptive decision-making.

🖼 Visual Workflow Builder — Drag-and-drop simplicity for non-technical users.

🔄 Self-Healing Workflows — Automatically recover from API changes or failures.

📊 Optimization Insights — Intelligent recommendations to improve efficiency.

🔐 Enterprise-Ready — Secure, scalable, and integration-friendly.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Mac, Windows, Linux)
* Clone this repo:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-workflow-automation.git
  cd ai-workflow-automation/backend
  ```

---

## 🛠️ Stage 1 – Local Development

For fast testing with auto-reload (FastAPI + Uvicorn):

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Visit: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
You should see:

```json
{"message": "Welcome to Cognistra - AI Workflow Automation"}
```

---

## 🏗️ Stage 2 – Production Setup

For optimized production (Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Visit: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 🔧 Useful Commands

```bash
# Stop containers
docker compose down
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Rebuild images (no cache)
docker compose build --no-cache
```

## 📌 Next Steps

* [ ] Add PostgreSQL database container
* [ ] Define API routes (`/workflows`, `/agents`, `/tasks`)
* [ ] Add `.env` config for secrets & DB URL
* [ ] Implement first AI workflow execution prototype
